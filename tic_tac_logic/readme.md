# Tic Tac Logic

This is a puzzle game where you need to place an X or O in every square so that every row or column has the same number of Xs and Os and there are never more than 2 of any symbol next to each other orthogonally. Additionally, you want to ensure that no two rows or columns are identical.

This might be a really good case for score shaping we can say a lot about what's a good decision here. Maybe we score more if we are 100% sure the placement is right.
